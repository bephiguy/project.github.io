<h2>Megan is my favorite person in the whole world! <br> She is wonderful, beautiful,and smart. (I mean jsut look at the website she built!) <br>
She draws the cutest doodles, can make her own pretty clothes,<br>has great fashion sense,always trys,sends me adorable selfies(more on that) <br>
I love to listen to her talk about her day and I love her company <br>even when she has nothing to say (of course I do dummy) <br>
I cant wait to see where things will go in our future and while she feels pesimistic <br>at times im filled with flowery thoughts and optimism so i'll try to have enough <br>
for the both of us.
